    <h2>Understanding the display property</h2>

    <p>
      The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine
      if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.
    </p>

    <code> .my-element { display: inline; } </code>

    <p>
      Inline elements behave like words in a sentence. They sit next to each
      other in the inline direction. Elements such as `span` and `strong`, which
      are typically used to style pieces of text within containing elements like
      a `p` (paragraph), are inline by default. They also preserve surrounding
      whitespace.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can't set an explicit width and height on inline elements. Any block
      level margin and padding will be ignored by the surrounding elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Flexbox</h2>

    <p>
      There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple
      elements, flexbox and grid. They share similarities, but are designed to
      solve different layout problems.
    </p>

    <div class="flex" style="width: 200px">
      <div class="box">I am sat next to a sibling element</div>
      <div class="box">I am sat next to a sibling element</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Items will stay on the same axis and not wrap when they run out of space.
      Instead they will try to squash onto the same line as each other. This
      behaviour can be changed using the align-items, justify-content and
      flex-wrap properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flexbox also converts the child elements to be flex items, which means you
      can write rules on how they behave inside a flex container. You can change
      alignment, order and justification on an individual item. You can also
      change how it shrinks or grows using the flex property.
    </p>

    <h2>Grid</h2>

    <p>
      Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control
      multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal
      space).
    </p>

    <div class="my-element">
      <div class="box">Item 1</div>
      <div class="box">Item 2</div>
      <div class="box">Item 3</div>
      <div class="box">Item 4</div>
      <div class="box">Item 5</div>
      <div class="box">Item 6</div>
      <div class="box">Item 7</div>
      <div class="box">Item 8</div>
    </div>
