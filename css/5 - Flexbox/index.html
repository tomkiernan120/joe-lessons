    <h1>Flexbox</h1>

    <p>A design pattern that can be tricky in responsive design is a sidebar that sits inline with some content. Where there is viewport space, this pattern works great, but where space is condensed, that rigid layout can become problematic.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">
            <article><p>This is an article of content that sits inline with a sidebar. There’s not enough room in the viewport at the moment so it’s all very squished.</p></article>
        </div>
        <aside class="sidebar">
            <p>This is a sidebar that is squished.</p>
        </aside>
    </div>
</body>
