    <h1>Box Model</h1>

    <p>
        A key thing to remember is everything displayed on a website is a box. 
        These boxes behave differently based on display. 
        They can also be styled differently but they are always boxes
    </p>

    <p>I am a paragraph of text that has a few words in it.</p>

    <p>Lets change the display css value and also inspect in the chrome dev tools to see the box model</p>

    <p>Lets now change the box-sizing values and inspect</p>

    <p>The box is made up of content box, padding box, border box, margin box</p>
